Following the archetype layed out before me I have chosen the ubiquitous title of "First Post" for my first blog post. Now never having written a blog before I am unsure of the writing style I should follow or how I should structure these things. Bearing this in my mind I guess I should start with giving credit where credit is due.

The creation of this blog/personal website occurred thanks largely to the opensource blogging framework [Octopress] built by Brandon Mathis on top of [Jekyll], the blog aware static site generator. I chose Octopress primarily due to it's ease of use in generating blog posts and pages with given css and javascripts. So I can focus mostly on content and if need be tweak the look of the site further down the road. Also, I like jekyll's philosophy of creating a static site with necessary html, css, and javascript pages, since I believe anything more for a personal website is a bit too much. 

Furthermore, this site utilizes the [cleanpress] Octopress theme built by [macjasp]. I made use of this theme due the clean form factor and design that it employed. Also, I feel that this style naturally focuses the user on the content which should be the focus of this personal website/blog. 

Alright, I think I have gotten enough experience with [markdown] for now.
