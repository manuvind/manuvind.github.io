Hi, my name is Anuvind V. Menon and welcome to my personal website. It mainly serves as a hub for my blog posts, overview of personal projects, and this about page. Currently, this website is under construction so some material may not be added until a later date dependent upon my schedule. 

Now for a little bit about myself, currently I am a Junior studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. If you would like to know more please see my [resume].
